• Create a function ft_count_if which will return the number of elements of the
array that return does not return 0 when passed to the function f.
• This function will be applied following the array’s order.
• Here’s how the function should be prototyped :
int ft_count_if(char **tab, int length, int(*f)(char*));

Here's the implementation of the `ft_count_if` function:

```c
int ft_count_if(char **tab, int length, int (*f)(char*))
{
    int count = 0;
    int i;

    for (i = 0; i < length; i++)
    {
        if (f(tab[i]) != 0)
            count++;
    }

    return count;
}
```

The `ft_count_if` function takes an array of strings `tab`, the length of the array `length`, and a function pointer `f` as parameters. It iterates through each element of the array and calls the function `f` with each string as an argument. If the function `f` returns a non-zero value, it increments the count variable. Finally, it returns the count of elements for which the function `f` returned a non-zero value.

You can use this function to count the number of elements in an array that satisfy a certain condition based on the provided function pointer.

Here's a test program for the `ft_count_if` function:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int is_even(char *str)
{
    int num = atoi(str);
    return (num % 2 == 0);
}

int main(void)
{
    char *tab[] = {"1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", NULL};
    int count = ft_count_if(tab, 10, &is_even);

    printf("Number of even elements in the array: %d\n", count);

    return 0;
}
```

In this test program, we define an array `tab` containing strings representing numbers. We use the `is_even` function as the condition to count the number of even elements in the array. The `is_even` function converts the string to an integer and checks if it's even or not.

We call the `ft_count_if` function with the array, the length of the array (excluding the null pointer), and the function pointer to `is_even`. The result is stored in the `count` variable.

Finally, we print the count of even elements in the array.

Make sure to include the necessary header files and compile the program with the appropriate flags.
